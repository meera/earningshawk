Analyze this audio transcript and determine if it is an earnings call.

{metadata_context}

VALIDATION (CRITICAL):
- Is this an actual earnings call with quarterly financial results?
- Or is it a product launch, interview, conference presentation, or other content?
- Set is_earnings_call = True ONLY if financial results are discussed

COMPANY DETECTION:
- Extract company name from transcript or metadata
- Extract stock ticker if mentioned (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, TSLA)
- Determine quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and year (2024, 2025)

SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION:
- Map SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc. to actual names
- Identify roles (CEO, CFO, IR Head, Analyst from [Firm])
- Use 'Unknown' only if name truly can't be identified from context

FINANCIAL METRICS:
- Extract key metrics: Revenue, EPS, Operating Income, Free Cash Flow, Margins
- Include exact values and % changes vs prior period
- Note timestamp when mentioned

HIGHLIGHTS (Optimized for YouTube Shorts 15-17 seconds):
- Extract 5-10 most impactful moments that work as standalone YouTube shorts
- Each highlight MUST be a COMPLETE SENTENCE or thought (not fragments)
- Target duration: 15-17 seconds when spoken (roughly 25-35 words)
- Prioritize: Major announcements (acquisitions, partnerships), surprising results (missed expectations, unusual factors),
  customer satisfaction metrics with specific numbers (e.g., "400 basis point increase"), market share claims,
  strategic pivots, meaningful guidance changes
- AVOID: Generic statements like "earnings call commenced", routine financial recaps, boilerplate language
- Include exact speaker attribution and precise timestamps
- Each highlight should contain newsworthy, shareable content that stands alone

CHAPTERS:
- Create clear chapter markers for major sections:
  - Opening Remarks, Financial Results, Business Update, Guidance, Q&A Session
- Use actual timestamps from transcript segments

ENTITY EXTRACTION (Extract as much structured data as possible):
- Companies Mentioned: Competitors, partners, customers, acquisition targets with relationship context
- Products: All products/services discussed (existing, new launches, discontinued, planned)
- Geographic Regions: Markets discussed with any associated metrics or performance data
- Executives: Key people mentioned (new hires, departures, board members) beyond call speakers
- Strategic Initiatives: Major announcements (acquisitions, partnerships, product launches, restructuring, investments)
- Guidance: All forward-looking metrics with periods and changes from prior guidance
- Risk Factors: Risks highlighted (market, regulatory, operational, competitive, financial) with severity
- Analyst Concerns: Key questions from Q&A with topics, firms, and management response summaries
- Sentiment: Overall tone analysis (management confidence, analyst sentiment, key themes, notable quotes)

SUMMARY:
- 2-3 paragraph narrative covering:
  - Financial performance highlights
  - Strategic announcements
  - Forward guidance
  - Key Q&A themes

YOUTUBE METADATA:
- Title: Optimized for search (include company, ticker, quarter, year)
